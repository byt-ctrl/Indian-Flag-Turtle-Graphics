## Indian Flag Drawing Using Python Turtle Graphics

This repository contains a Python script that uses the Turtle Graphics library to draw the Indian national flag 🇮🇳, complete with the Ashoka Chakra at its center. The program demonstrates basic graphical programming techniques such as drawing rectangles and circles, and creating intricate designs like the spokes of the Ashoka Chakra. 🎨🐢

### 🖥️ Overview
The program first sets up the dimensions and colors of the Indian flag, dividing it into three horizontal stripes:
- 🟧 **Saffron** (Top)
- ⚪ **White** (Middle)
- 🟩 **Green** (Bottom)

After drawing the flag, the Ashoka Chakra, which consists of a navy blue circle with 24 spokes, is drawn at the center of the white stripe. The program creates a detailed representation of the flag and the Chakra using basic turtle graphics commands.

### 🛠️ Functions

1. **`draw_rectangle`**: 
   - Responsible for drawing the three colored rectangles (saffron, white, and green) that form the flag.
   - Takes parameters like color, position, and size of the rectangle and fills them accordingly.

2. **`draw_chakra`**: 
   - Draws the Ashoka Chakra at the center of the white stripe.
   - First draws the outer circle and then uses a loop to draw the 24 spokes of the Chakra.

### 🌈 Features
- The flag is displayed on a **black background** .
- The drawing process is animated, showing how the flag is constructed step by step.
- Once the drawing is complete, the window stays open until manually closed by the user.

### 🚀 Requirements
- Python 🐍
- Turtle Graphics (usually included by default with Python)

### ⚡ How to Run
To run the program, ensure that Python is installed on your machine along with the Turtle Graphics library (which is included in standard Python installations). After that Simply run the Python script containing the code, and the Indian flag will be drawn on the screen.
